Day 1:
Birthday ❤️
Visited the Central Market, saw the centre, ate Empanadas ( bags with cheese and other stuff). 
Sooo many palmas 🌴 and we saw wild tangerines 🍊 between the cars on the road
Bus tickets are 2€/person
Went to the Malvarrosa Beach, ate fish at the beach restaurant. Wanted to bath but the water was somehow dirty (brown-ish) and we decided to go only ankle depth.
The sunbeds and the umbrella were 9€ each (didn't pay) 
Then we walked on the beach for about 1.5 hours, very beautiful beach with amazing sand. 
There were a lot of nudists on the beach 😂
We got veeery nice chocolate cake and wine and celebrated the birthday on the balcony of the Airbnb.

Day 2 (💍- 17.09.25): 
Went to Jardin de Turia and walking from there we reached the Jardines de Monforte! 

Day 3: Visited the City of Science in Valencia. Saw very cool sun clocks there in the main park. Walked around the museum and the water park there.
